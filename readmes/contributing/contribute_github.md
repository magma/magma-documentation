## Areas Seeking Contributors

### Juju-Based Deployment Scripts

The Juju-based deployment scripts for Magma are currently **unmaintained**. These scripts are retained for legacy and ecosystem reasons but are not actively maintained by the core team.

Community contributors are encouraged to help maintain and modernize them. If you are interested, please engage via:

- [GitHub Issue #15763](https://github.com/magma/magma/issues/15763) – Canonical tracking issue for Juju scripts
- [GitHub Issue #15755](https://github.com/magma/magma/issues/15755) – Earlier deprecation proposal (superseded)
- [Magma Slack channels](https://magmacore.slack.com/)

**Affected documentation:**

- Deploy AGW using Juju
- Deploy Orchestrator using Juju
- Charmed Magma tutorials

**Recommended alternatives:** For actively maintained deployment, consider using the Docker-based AGW installation or the Magma Deployer repository.
